tracepath command in Linux is used to traces path to destination discovering MTU along this path.
''' 
MTU stands for Maximum Transmission Unit : it is the maximum size of the packet that can be transmitted from a network interface. All the devices including servers and switches/routers involved in communication should have the same MTU size.
