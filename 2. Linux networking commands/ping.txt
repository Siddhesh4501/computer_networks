ping command is used for troubleshooting, testing and diagnosing network connectivity issues. 

It works by sending one or more ICMP(Internet Control Message Protocol) Echo Request packages to a specified destination IP on the network and waits for a reply. When the destination receives the package, it responds with an ICMP echo reply. You can also find the round-trip delay in communicating with the destination and check whether there is a packet loss.

A remote destination's upstate/downstate can be determined using ping command WHEN NOT BEHIND A PROXY. It is so because, 'ping' needs a direct network connection on the IP level to do this work. A proxy works on a higher layer of the TCP/IP network model, where there is no direct access to the IP protocol. This can be changed though with certain firewall settings or 'httping' command can be used as an alternative.
