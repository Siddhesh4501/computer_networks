ifconfig stands for "interface configuration." It is used to view and change the configuration of the network interfaces on your system.

Syntax:
ifconfig [-a] [-v] [-s] <interface> [[<AF>] <address>]

It displays the information about all network interfaces currently in operation.
Here, enp2s0, lo and wlp3s0 are the active network interfaces.

enp2s0 -> It is the first ethernet interface. Additional ethernet interfaces would be named enp2s1, enp2s2, etc.
lo     -> It is the loopback interface. This is a special network interface that the system uses to communicate with itself.
wlp3s0 -> It is the name of the first wireless network on the system. Additional wireless interfaces would be named wlp3s1, wlp3s2, etc.

COMMANDS:

1) ifconfig -a 
This produces output similar to running ifconfig, but if there are any inactive interfaces on the system, their configuration is also shown.

2) Enabling and disabling an interface
sudo ifconfig enp2s0 up   (activate)
sudo ifconfig enp2s0 down (deactivate)

3) Configure an interface
'''Assign a static IP address to an interface'''
sudo ifconfig [interface] [IP]
e.g.
sudo ifconfig wlp3s0 69.72.169.1

4) Assign a network mask to an interface 
sudo ifconfig [interface] netmask [mask]
e.g. 
sudo ifconfig enp2s0 netmask 255.255.255.0

5) Assign a broadcast address to an interface 
sudo ifconfig [interface] broadcast [address]
e.g. 
sudo ifconfig enp2s0 broadcast 172.16.25.98

6) Combine the above commands into one :
sudo ifconfig enp2s0 192.168.2.5 netmask 255.255.255.0 broadcast 192.168.2.7


ifconfig is used to configure the system's kernel-resident network interfaces. It is used at boot time to set up interfaces as necessary. After that, it is usually only needed when debugging, or when system tuning is needed.

--------------------------------------------------
NOTE : 
ifconfig can only assign a static IP address to a network interface. If you want to assign a dynamic IP address using DHCP, use the dhclient command.
